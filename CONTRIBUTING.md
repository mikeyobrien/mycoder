# Contributing to MyCoder

First off, thank you for considering contributing to MyCoder! It's people like you that make MyCoder such a great tool.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our Code of Conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 20.0.0
- pnpm >= 10.2.1
- PostgreSQL (for Dashboard)
- Google Cloud SDK (for cloud features)
- Git

### Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mycoder-monorepo.git
   cd mycoder-monorepo
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
4. Build all packages:
   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```
5. Start development servers:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

## Project Architecture

### Monorepo Structure

- `/packages/*` - All project packages
  - `agent` - Core AI agent system
  - `cli` - Command-line interface

## Development Workflow

1. Create a new branch for your feature/fix:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes, following our coding standards:

   - Use TypeScript for all new code
   - Follow the existing code style
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

3. Run tests and checks:

   ```bash
   pnpm test        # Run tests
   pnpm typecheck   # Type checking
   pnpm lint        # Linting
   pnpm format      # Code formatting
   ```

4. Commit your changes:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"
   ```

   Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.

5. Push to your fork and create a Pull Request

6. Pre-commit Hooks:

   We use [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) and [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) to automatically run linting and formatting on staged files before each commit. This helps maintain code quality and consistency.

   The pre-commit hooks are configured to run:

   - `pnpm lint`: Lints the staged files using ESLint
   - `pnpm format`: Formats the staged files using Prettier

   If either of these commands fails due to linting errors or formatting issues, the commit will be aborted. Please fix the reported issues and try committing again.

   You can also run the lint and format commands manually at any time:

   ```bash
   pnpm lint        # Lint all files
   pnpm format      # Format all files
   ```
